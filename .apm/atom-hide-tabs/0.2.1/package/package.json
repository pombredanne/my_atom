The problem is that I also don't like tabs (I know, I'm picky), and the shortcut doesn't work if the `tabs` package is disabled. The solution? Hide them. It might be a dirty hack, but I'm ok with it.\n\n## How?\n\nAfter installing the package just run the `atom-hide-tabs:toggle` command from the command palette or through the defined shortcut (default is `ctrl-alt-t`). If you want to run this automatically, you can add the following line to your init script:\n\n```javascript\natom.commands.dispatch(atom.views.getView(atom.workspace), 'atom-hide-tabs:toggle');\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/gianmarcotoso/atom-hide-tabs/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/gianmarcotoso/atom-hide-tabs#readme","_id":"atom-hide-tabs@0.2.1","_shasum":"2f0577019afe5837fbc8784bca7fd7a3869bae52","_resolved":"file:../d-11665-77911-1fmjtey/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11665-77911-1fmjtey/package.tgz"}
